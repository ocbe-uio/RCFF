# RCFF

This package follows up on a [proposal shared on the citation-file-format GitHub page](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/issues/110#issue-648726798)
by providing tools to convert between the standardized Citation File Format (CFF) and the structure of an R package DESCRIPTION file.

This package is still very early in development.
